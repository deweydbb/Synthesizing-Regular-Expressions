# Synthesizing Regular Expressions From Examples with Version Spaces

This was my final project for CS 393P Program Synthesis. A poster image that gives a good summary of the project and how it works can be found [here](SynthesisPoster.svg). A more detailed report on the project can be found [here](Synthesis_Final_Project_Report.pdf).

The project is heavily influenced by [Automating string processing in spreadsheets using input-output examples](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/popl11-synthesis.pdf) by Sumit Gulwani.
